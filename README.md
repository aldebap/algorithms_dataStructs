# Algorithms & Data Structures

This repository was created to implement all algorithms &amp; data structure from Sedgewick's book _Algorithms in C++_
using Golang 1.17

## Chapter 3

This chapter presents fundamental data structures.
Implementations:

1. [Linked Lists](https://github.com/aldebap/algorithms_dataStructs/tree/main/chapter_3/linkedList)
2. [Linked Lists as Array](https://github.com/aldebap/algorithms_dataStructs/tree/main/chapter_3/linkedList)
3. [Stacks](https://github.com/aldebap/algorithms_dataStructs/tree/main/chapter_3/stack)
4. [Queues](https://github.com/aldebap/algorithms_dataStructs/tree/main/chapter_3/queue)

A simple mathematical [expressions parser](https://github.com/aldebap/algorithms_dataStructs/tree/main/chapter_3/expression)
was also implemented as a practical example of using stacks and queues.
This parser works with simple expression:

- only the four basic operation;
- only positive integes numbers;
- no precedence of operations, which means that in order to make multiplication have precedence over addition parenthesis
must be used. Ex: ```2 + ( 3 * 5 )```
- every token must be separated by a white space;

## Chapter 4

This chapter presents another fundamental data structure.
Implementation:

1. [Binary Tree](https://github.com/aldebap/algorithms_dataStructs/tree/main/chapter_4/binaryTree)

## Chapter 5

This chapter presents the concepts of recursion and "divide and conquer".
Implementation:

1. [Factorial & Fibonacci](https://github.com/aldebap/algorithms_dataStructs/tree/main/chapter_5/recursiveMath)

## Chapter 8
